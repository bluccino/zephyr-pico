Zephyr jump-start utilizing the Pico framework

## Intro

Zephyr is a powerful eco system for embedded application. In comprises an SDK (software development kit), a codebase supporting all kinds of modules from the kernel level, driver layer up to higher level modules like an event queuing system or an MQTT server. Zephyr provides open software supporting various SoCs and SoC architectures, hundreds of elctronic components and embedded boards. The real power of Zephyr comes with the scalability of the real time system, and KCONFIG is the configuration system which allows the flexible configuration of the kernel for each individual embedded application, together with the devicetree system, which is used for representation of each individual hardware board, down to each bus system and electrical component on the board. There is also the Zephyr test environment allowing the definitition of a unit test harness and the execution of automated tests. And finally there are Zephyr manifests which are used to pull version controlled subsystems
into a project in a well defined way.

If you jump-start into the Zephyr eco system, be prepared that you might get in touch with a lot of unknown animals, and be also prepared that you might need to learn a lot about how to deal with those animals appropriately.
